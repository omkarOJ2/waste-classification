# waste-classification
Project Summary: Waste Classification using Machine Learning
This project focuses on classifying waste as recyclable or organic using a machine learning model. The model is trained on a dataset of waste images using deep learning techniques, primarily CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks). The Jupyter Notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps to achieve accurate classification.

How It Works:
Dataset Handling: Downloads and organizes a Kaggle waste classification dataset.

Model Training: Uses a CNN-based model to classify waste images.

Evaluation: Analyzes model accuracy and performance on test data.

Key Features:
✔ Waste classification using deep learning.
✔ Implementation in Jupyter Notebook (no separate application or interface).
✔ Potential for further development into a full API or web-based system.
